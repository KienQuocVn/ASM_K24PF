									Performance: The Intel Core i7-13650HX and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 combo is a beast!
									Every game I've tested so far runs smoothly at high settings. The 16GB DDR5 RAM
									ensures multitasking is a breeze, whether I’m gaming, streaming, or working on video
									edits.
									<br><br>Display: The 16-inch, 16:10 FHD display with a 165Hz refresh rate is a
									game-changer. The visuals are buttery smooth, vibrant, and crisp. It’s perfect for
									fast-paced games where every millisecond counts.
									<br><br>Build and Design: The laptop feels premium and sturdy. The cooling system is
									excellent, keeping the machine cool even during intense gaming sessions. The RGB
									lighting on the keyboard adds a stylish touch.
									<br><br>Value for Money: For its price, this laptop packs incredible features that
									cater to gamers and content creators alike. It’s future-proof and ready to handle
									even the most demanding tasks.
									<br><br>Overall Experience: This is hands down one of the best gaming laptops I’ve
									ever owned. ASUS nailed it with this model, providing top-notch performance,
									cutting-edge features, and excellent build quality. Highly recommended for anyone
									looking for a powerful, versatile machine. 👏
									<br><br>If you're considering this laptop, don’t hesitate—it’s worth every penny!

									The 2025 version of this laptop comes with the Ultra 9 285H CPU, which was worth the
									wait. There are a ton of YouTube video reviews, so I will not go into all of the
									details - you should definitely watch them first, but here are my pros and cons.
									<br><br>Pros:
									<br>You can use it like a regular laptop, and it is totally stable and the keyboard
									is *great*.
									<br>The OLED screens are beautiful and bright (though reflective in bright light).
									<br>The vertical mode is super stable and easy to get used to.
									<br>Moving apps between screens is simple, and I have had no problems at all.
									<br>In "standard" mode, I almost never hear the fans, even with multiple programs
									running.
									<br>The system uses a small 65W power brick...any 65W or higher PD brick will be
									fine.
									<br>The premium body is not a fingerprint magnet.
									<br>Battery life seems good, but I have not used it too much without AC
									<br>Comes with the active pen, but I have no use for it
									<br>The MyAsus application is very good, and puts the system controls in one place
									<br><br>Cons:
									<br>Heavier than your usual 14" laptop, but you have 2 screens :-)
									<br>Two Thunderbolt 4 ports - why not TB 5?
									<br>The keyboard battery life when removed from the body seems a bit short when the
									backlight is on
									<br>The CPU can take more power, but it is limited in this machine to prevent it
									from throttling too much
									<br>Battery life is limited due to the two screens, but that is to be expected
									<br>Why not Win 11 Professional instead of Home for a premium device?
									<br>There is only 1 M.2 slot for storage, which is a bummer
									<br><br>Overall, this is one of the best machines I have ever used. Applications are
									quick, and I am never waiting for something to respond. This is NOT a gaming
									machine, regardless of what you might hear. The iGPU is not the best that Intel has
									to offer, and the NPU for AI is weaker than most - but for what it is meant to do,
									it excels. This is a business laptop dream - if you multi-task a lot, edit multiple
									documents at once, etc., it is perfect. Did I mention how great the keyboard is? :-)
									<br><br>Highly recommended!

									I'm obsessed with my new Asus ZenScreen O-LED 15.6" monitor!
									<br>As someone who's always on the move, I needed a portable display that could keep
									up with me - and this thing delivers. The OLED screen is insane, with colors that
									pop and a level of detail that's hard to believe in a device this small.
									<br>Plus, it's super lightweight, making it easy to toss into my bag and take
									wherever I go.
									<br>The magnetic stand is also a total game-changer - it's sturdy, adjustable, and
									keeps the screen safe from scratches when I'm traveling.
									<br>One thing to keep in mind: you'll need to bring your own mini HDMI to HDMI cable
									to get started, which is a bit of a bummer.
									<br>And if you want to power it up, you'll need an extra USB-C cable - but honestly,
									that's not a huge deal.
									<br>Despite those minor quirks, this monitor has been a total lifesaver for me.
									Whether I'm working from a coffee shop or trying to squeeze in some gaming at home,
									the Asus ZenScreen is the perfect companion. And let's be real - it's also a great
									option if you're short on space, since it's so compact and easy to set up. All in
									all, I'm thoroughly impressed with this little monitor - it's a total winner!

									This product is pre-purchased, opened and upgraded, it is not exactly new as they
									state (this was not stated clearly in the description).
									<br>Also as another review mentions they don't do a good job with the upgrading
									parts.
									<br>I paid extra for the 2tb sdd version and to my surprise, only around 500gb was
									available.
									<br>Asus support was of no help as they said they only make this model with a 512gb
									sdd.
									<br>I reached out to the vendor with no answer or support from him. After many
									attempts to fix this, in case anyone else needs this, was to do a clean windows
									installation with an external drive (this is important), and removing all the
									default partitions.
									<br>Beware that this will cause the touchpad, wifi, and most components from the
									computer not responding.
									<br>Make sure to predownload all required drivers and put them in the installation
									external drive.
									<br>Hope this helps anyone who already purchased this and is having this issue, but
									for no buyers, I'd recommend looking somewhere else.

									I initially wasn’t considering ASUS at all, because I thought their keyboards were
									way too expensive and had my eyes on something around a hundred bucks, like
									Key-chron.
									<br>But I stumbled upon a discount on the ROG Azoth, which dropped from $250 down to
									$179, and decided to take the plunge.
									<br>Honestly, this keyboard feels like the “Vertu” of keyboards: a premium metal
									chassis, fantastic linear switches (hot-swappable, no less), instant syncing across
									Bluetooth, 2.4 GHz, and wired modes, plus an incredibly deep, quiet typing sound.
									<br>It gives off a real “flagship smartphone” vibe—pure luxury and top-tier quality.

									<br><br>I’ve got to hand it to ASUS’s marketing on Amazon, because that sale is
									exactly what made me go for it.
									<br>Without that steep discount, I probably would’ve stuck to a more budget-friendly
									option.
									<br>But once I realized the price gap wasn’t that huge anymore, I figured I’d get
									something truly high-end for nearly the same money.
									<br>After unboxing it, I was sold. I genuinely don’t think I can go back to any
									other keyboards now. In my opinion, this is the best 75% model I’ve ever seen—maybe
									only some “Extreme” version could top it.
									<br>If you’re on the hunt for a “keyboard for years to come,” this is it.

									I have never written an Amazon review before but this headsets score is way to low.
									<br>It is an excellent headset that I would highly recommend except for 2 specific
									reasons that’s someone might not like it. 1.
									<br>The headset is quite large so if you have a small head definitely stay away.
									<br>I have a medium to a large head and it’s still fairly loose on me even on its
									tightest setting.
									<br>Secondly the headset is not great at keeping our external audio so if you are in
									a loud environment or you want serious noise cancelling this isn’t the headset for
									you.
									<br>Besides those 2 points this thing is excellent the audio is great, the software
									is great (besides the sleep function not working currently hoping it gets patched
									soon), the comfort is top notch, and the microphone is crystal clear.
									<br>Coming from a Razor Kraken v3 pro this thing is a huge step up and it’s a joy to
									use.
									<br>The battery life is also insane I have had it for over 2 weeks and haven't
									charged it once it’s still at 50% and that’s using it all day. Definitely worth the
									purchase.

									I’ve been searching for a while for the perfect gaming earbuds.
									<br>I tried the razer hammerheads wireless way back when they first came out, and
									they were alright.
									<br>Since then, I’ve been looking for something else as I hate wearing a headset and
									find them bulky and that they take up too much space on a desk, even with a hook.
									<br><br>I tried the regular ROG Cetra, but the Bluetooth just had too much lag to
									make it enjoyable for the games I was playing.
									<br>It was about 1/4-1/2 second behind, but it was enough to be noticeable.
									Otherwise the buds themselves were comfortable.
									<br><br>Then, onto Anker Soundcore VRp10. These were great with the dongle, and they
									connected well to my pc, vr headset, and cell phone.
									<br>The volume left some to be desired and the quality was alright, but the
									microphone was useless.
									<br><br>After those, I tried the JBL Quantums, which sounded better, had a decent
									connection with their dongle, but just couldn’t stay charged, plus weren’t the most
									comfortable.
									<br><br>Now onto the Rog Cetra Speednovas, and dang these are great!
									<br>They sound just as good as my AirPod pro’s, the audio is clear with no hiccups,
									and has fantastic range.
									<br>I love not having to worry about a wire, and they recharge fast in the case. The
									microphone is great too.
									<br>My only gripe is that there is no easy way to store the dongle with the carrying
									case so I’ll have to plan to bring that separately somehow whenever I go on a trip.
									<br>I’d highly recommend these to anyone who’s had a hard time finding the perfect
									earbuds since I went through that enough already.
									<br>I have every intention to change my review if I run into an issue with quality
									or performance in the future. But for now, they’re practically perfect!

									I recently got the ASUS ROG Raikiri Pro, and it has completely elevated my gaming
									experience.
									<br>The OLED display is a standout feature, providing clear and useful information
									right on the controller.
									<br>The tri-mode connectivity ensures seamless switching between my PC and Xbox,
									making it incredibly versatile.

									<br><br>The re-mappable buttons and triggers, along with the four rear buttons,
									offer a high level of customization, allowing me to tailor the controller to my
									gaming style.
									<br>The step and linear triggers provide precise control, which is especially useful
									in racing and shooting games.
									<br>The adjustable joystick sensitivity is another great feature, giving me the
									exact responsiveness I need for different types of games.

									<br><br>The 3.5mm jack with ESS DAC delivers excellent audio quality, enhancing my
									overall gaming experience.
									<br>The build quality is top-notch, and the controller feels comfortable during long
									gaming sessions.

									<br><br>Overall, the ASUS ROG Raikiri Pro is an exceptional controller packed with
									features that cater to both casual and competitive gamers. Highly recommended!
